## About

I am passionate about leveraging data to gain insights and solve problems. Check out my [resume](link-to-resume) to learn more about my experience and skills.

## Projects

## Machine Learning Projects
#### 1. Census Project

**Problem Description:** This project involves preprocessing and exploring the Census Income dataset to understand its features through exploratory analysis and visualization. Subsequently, classification algorithms will be employed to predict whether an individual earns over 50,000 a year or less. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comprises income details of over 30,000 individuals from the 1994 US census.  

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
- 74% of the people are under the working class "Private" in the census data.
- The highest Mean capital gain is for the "Self-employed" working class, and "withoutpay" working class has the lowest Mean capital gain in the census data.
- Approximately 52% of people from the United States are private employees and earn less than 50,000 annually in the census data.
- Around 5% of high school graduates earn more than 50,000 annually in the census data.
